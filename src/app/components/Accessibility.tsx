This file contains prototype accessibility code that is not yet fully implemented.

Some basic accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) have been implemented directly in NetworkVisualization.tsx, but advanced features are still TODO:

TODO: To implement:
  - Focus ring styling for keyboard navigation
  - Keyboard shortcuts panel (e.g., Tab to navigate, Enter to select)
  - Screen reader announcements for path highlighting
  - Skip links for large visualizations
  - High contrast mode support
