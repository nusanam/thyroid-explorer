Research the Connections
You need to map out the actual biological pathways. Here's the structure:
Primary Thyroid Markers → Intermediate Effects → Reproductive Outcomes
Thyroid Markers (Left Column):

TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)

Normal: 0.5-4.5 mIU/L
Optimal for fertility: < 2.5 mIU/L
Subclinical hypo: 2.5-10 mIU/L


Free T3 (Active thyroid hormone)

Normal: 2.3-4.2 pg/mL
Optimal: Upper half of range


Free T4 (Inactive form, converts to T3)

Normal: 0.8-1.8 ng/dL
Optimal: Mid-range


TPO Antibodies (Thyroid Peroxidase)

Normal: < 35 IU/mL
Elevated = autoimmune (Hashimoto's)


Thyroglobulin Antibodies

Normal: < 20 IU/mL
Elevated = autoimmune



Intermediate Effects (Middle Layer):

Basal Metabolic Rate

Affected by: T3, T4
Influences: Energy production, cellular function


Basal Body Temperature

Affected by: T3, T4
Influences: BBT charting accuracy, ovulation detection


Progesterone Production

Affected by: TSH, T3 (thyroid hormones needed for corpus luteum function)
Influences: Luteal phase length


Liver Hormone Clearance

Affected by: T3 (regulates liver enzyme activity)
Influences: Estrogen metabolism, hormone balance


Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

Affected by: Thyroid status
Influences: Free testosterone, estrogen availability


Prolactin Levels

Affected by: TSH (TRH stimulates prolactin)
Influences: Ovulation suppression when high


Ovarian Function

Affected by: Thyroid hormones (receptors on ovaries)
Influences: Follicle development, egg quality


Immune System Activation

Affected by: TPO/TG antibodies
Influences: Inflammation, pregnancy complications



Reproductive Outcomes (Right Column):

Cycle Regularity

Influenced by: Multiple pathways
Measurement: Days between cycles (25-35 normal)


Ovulation Consistency

Influenced by: Progesterone, ovarian function, prolactin
Measurement: % anovulatory cycles


Luteal Phase Length

Influenced by: Progesterone production
Measurement: Days (10-16 normal, <10 concerning)


Egg Quality

Influenced by: Ovarian function, metabolic rate
Markers: AMH, FSH response


Time to Conception

Influenced by: All of the above
Measurement: Months (6-12 normal)


Early Pregnancy Loss Risk

Influenced by: Progesterone, antibodies, immune system
Measurement: % (15-20% baseline, higher with thyroid issues)


BBT Pattern Clarity

Influenced by: Basal temperature regulation
Measurement: Biphasic pattern distinctness
